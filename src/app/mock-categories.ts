Contemporary artists draw from the current moment, challenging viewers to consider their reality through another lens.

    description: 'The Impressionists radically challenged the conventions of artmaking, rejecting the established academic style in favor of loose brushstrokes to capture atmospheric landscapes. From Cubism to Surrealism, the modern art movements that followed continued this avant-garde sensibility, introducing radical new forms of expression such as abstract painting and conceptual sculpture. Spanning roughly 1860 to 1945, the category of Impressionist and modern art also represents some of the most expensive works ever sold at auction, including Pablo Picasso’s Les Femmes d’Alger (Version O) (1955) at $179.4 million, and Amedeo Modigliani’s Nu Couche (1917) at $170.4 million, Edvard Munch’s The Scream (1893) at $120' +

Keith Haring famously turned the New York City subway system into his canvas, KAWS broke into telephone booths and graffitied their advertising panels, and Banksy played a trick on the art world when he shredded his million-dollar canvas Girl With Balloon (2006) after it sold at auction.
